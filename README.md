# Introduction to AI Tutorials

This github repoitory contains code for Introduction to Supervised Learning and Introduction to Deep Learning courses. You can run the notebooks on Google colab. All code is in python and all neural networks are built in pytorch.

## Introduction to Supervised Learning
### Part 1: Regression
We will use the California house price dataset.

### Part 2: Classification
We will use the Titanic survival rate dataset.

## Introduction to Deep Learning
### Part 3: Deep neural networks
We will use the same data as part 1, the California house price dataset.


### Part 4: Computer vision 
We will build a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier to classify cats and dogs, using the Oxford-IIIT-Pet dataset.
